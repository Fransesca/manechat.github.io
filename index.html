				I hereby confirm to have read the rules below and will follow them.
				I am also aware that not doing so might result in a permanent ban from the server.

			<h1>Rules</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Manechat! Keep it family friendly and SFW. Breaking the rules will result in being muted, kicked, or banned. Fundamentally, our rules are mostly the same as the /r/mylittlepony subreddit rules, subject to moderator discretion.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Be pony-like and kind to other members.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Trolling, impersonation, and similar acts are not acceptable!</li>
						<li>Follow common courtesy in voice chat. Keep it SFW, do not disturb in-progress games with off-topic chatter, and properly calibrate your microphone.</li>
						<li>Users that consistently create negative experiences for other users will be removed, even if no singular event would be considered severe.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>No offensive, controversial, or NSFW avatars, pictures, emotes, or topics. This means no politics or religion.</li>
				<li>All discussion, pictures, and any related content about the upcoming My Little Pony: A New Generation movie must be kept in the appropriately named spoiler channel <span class="channel_name">#g5-spoilers-leaks</span>. If it was shown in the trailer you can also use <span class="channel_name">#g5-trailer</span>.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>MLP content that airs ahead of time is considered spoilers, even if it comes from an official source.<br><i>Examples: G5 movie airs in Hong Kong before Netflix release, or a book comes out that spoils the plot of an unreleased movie/episode</i></li>
						<li>Do not carelessly spoil important plot points of any media <strong>in general</strong>, regardless of its age.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Shitposting, spamming, and low-effort memes are prohibited. Don't use excessively illegible characters in usernames or text.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Do not exercise excessive roleplay anywhere on the server. This is not the place for RP.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Links to other Discord servers, patreons, gofundmes and similar are not allowed. This includes PMing members of the server with spam.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Links to streams, channels, and other self-promotion should be posted only once per 24 hours.</li>
						<li>Advertising commissions, YCHs, and other art related services in exchange for money should be kept to <span class="channel_name">#my-creations</span> and no more often than once a week.</li>
						<li>Please consider contacting a Princess if someone on the server, without asking for it, PMs you with links of advertisement, publicity, self-promotion or similar.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>We are not a support group. If you need help, please seek out the help of a professional in your area.<br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines">International List of Crisis Hotlines</a>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Do not enforce the rules or try to regulate behaviour, that is exclusively the Princesses' responsibility. If you think or feel a rule is being breached, or you have concerns, PM a Princess without worry.</p>
			<p><strong>All Princess decisions are final.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Princesses have full discretion to remove content or users deemed unpleasant or unwelcomed by community members.</li>
				<li>Princesses have full discretion to change channel topics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Respect <a href="https://discordapp.com/tos">Discord's Terms of Service</a>.</p>
			<p>Abusing or exploiting bugs in Sweetie Bot or Discord itself is a bannable offense.</p>
			<p>If you'd like to appeal a ban or otherwise communicate with the Princesses outside of Discord, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyb-rUEI17NK8xwhbrTJfcsXJegFMdDDFNBoHswDmIwKAemA/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill this form</a> and we'll get back to you.</p>
